Its function is to \npump blood throughout your body. As your heart beats, the walls of the \nheart squeeze, sending nearly 12 pints of blood throughout your body \nevery minute. In a normal heart, it takes less than one minute for blood \nto travel from your heart to your big toe and back. In that minute, your \nheart will beat 60 to 80 times.\nThe illustration below shows the body’s circulation. The heart pumps \noxygen-rich blood throughout the body via arteries (shown in red); veins \n(shown in blue) bring blood back to the heart.How Your Heart Works\nCirculation Throughout Your Body\nHeart\nVeins",

The bypasses go around the blocked ar -\ntery (or arteries) to create new pathways for oxygen-rich blood to flow to \nthe heart muscle. \nTo perform the operation, the heart may be stopped and you will be \nplaced on circulatory support, called cardiopulmonary bypass or the \nheart-lung machine. This support works in place of your heart and lungs \nto circulate blood to your body and provide oxygen.\nIn some patients, coronary artery bypass grafting is performed on a \nbeating heart. The heart is not stopped during the operation and the \npatient is not placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. This technique is not \nfor all patients, so please discuss the options with your surgeon.\nYou may need one or more of your arteries to be bypassed. The grafts \nused to make a bypass usually come from the internal mammary artery \n(in the chest wall), the greater saphenous vein (in the legs), or the ra-\ndial artery (in the arms). The location and size of your blockage and your \nother medical conditions determines which graft is most appropriate.\nThere are several systems of veins in your legs. If the greater saphenous \nvein is used, the other systems take over to provide adequate blood return \nfrom the legs. Blood flow into the leg is not changed by the removal of \nthe vein. When used, one end of the removed vein is sewn onto the aorta \nand the other end is sewn or grafted onto the coronary artery below the \nblockage.\nIf the mammary artery is used, one end may remain attached at its origin \nand the other end is sewn onto the coronary artery below the blockage.",

Its use is limited to specific conditions and your doctor \nwill advise you if this is an option for you.\nWhat is Involved in a TAVR Procedure?\nUnlike surgical aortic valve replacement, which involves surgically open -\ning the chest to replace a patient’s aortic valve, the minimally invasive \nTAVR can be done through very small incisions.\nThe TAVR procedure uses a catheter to insert the new valve. This can be \nperformed in a few ways, depending on the surgeon’s recommendation. \nThese include:\n•\tTransfemoral approach:  The surgeon enters via a needle \npuncture through a large artery in the groin (femoral artery).  \n•\tTransapical approach: The surgeon makes a small incision in \nthe chest between the ribs and enters through a large artery in \nthe chest or through the tip of the left ventricle (apex).  \n•\tTransaortic approach:  The surgeon makes a small incision in \nthe upper chest. The valve is delivered by a catheter through \nthe ascending aorta.\nNote: Staff will provide more TAVR information and \neducation to patients evaluated for this procedure.TAVR Procedure\n\n--- Page 24 of data/biology heart chapter 1.pdf ---",
